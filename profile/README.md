# Extensible Workflow System: Applications

[Ewoks](https://ewoks.esrf.fr) is a framework for automating data processing and experiments
at large-scale facilities in a reproducible, traceable, and portable manner.

It is a _meta workflow system_ that can execute the same computation graph using different [workflow management systems](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language/wiki/Existing-Workflow-systems).

[Ewoks Apps](https://ewoks.esrf.fr/en/latest/tasks/index.html) and libraries that implement _Ewoks tasks_
which can be used as nodes on _Ewoks workflows_.
